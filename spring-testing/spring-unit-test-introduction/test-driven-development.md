## [What is Test-Driven Development (TDD)](https://medium.com/gitconnected/i-stopped-coding-without-tests-how-tdd-improved-my-skills-c592115e1494)?
Test-Driven Development is a software development practice that encourages writing tests before writing the actual code. It follows a simple cycle:

- Write a failing test that describes the functionality you want to implement.
- Write the minimum amount of code necessary to make the test pass.
- Refactor the code to improve its quality while ensuring the test continues to pass.

The explanation you've requested pertains to the core cycle of Test-Driven Development (TDD), which revolves around three primary steps:

1. **Write a Failing Test (Red Phase)**
2. **Write the Minimum Amount of Code to Make the Test Pass (Green Phase)**
3. **Refactor the Code (Refactor Phase)**

Let's break down each step with an example:

### 1. Write a Failing Test (Red Phase)
- **Purpose:** Define what you want your code to do. The test should be written based on the requirements or feature you are trying to implement. Initially, since the functionality is not yet implemented, this test will fail (hence the "Red" phase in TDD terminology).
- **Example:** Suppose we are developing a feature in a shopping cart application to calculate the total price of items. We start by writing a test for a function `calculateTotalPrice` that doesn't exist yet.

  ```java
  @Test
  public void testCalculateTotalPrice() {
      ShoppingCart cart = new ShoppingCart();
      cart.addItem(new Item("Apple", 1.20, 2));  // Adding 2 apples at $1.20 each
      cart.addItem(new Item("Banana", 0.80, 3)); // Adding 3 bananas at $0.80 each

      double totalPrice = cart.calculateTotalPrice();
      assertEquals(4.80, totalPrice, 0.001); // 2*1.20 + 3*0.80 = 4.80
  }
  ```
  This test will fail because `calculateTotalPrice` hasn't been implemented yet.

### 2. Write the Minimum Amount of Code to Make the Test Pass (Green Phase)
- **Purpose:** Implement just enough code to make the failing test pass. This is about meeting the test's requirements as simply and directly as possible.
- **Example:** To pass the test, we implement the `calculateTotalPrice` method in the simplest way possible.

  ```java
  public class ShoppingCart {
      // ... other methods and properties ...

      public double calculateTotalPrice() {
          double total = 0;
          for (Item item : items) {
              total += item.getPrice() * item.getQuantity();
          }
          return total;
      }
  }
  ```
  This implementation is straightforward and enough to make our test pass.

### 3. Refactor the Code (Refactor Phase)
- **Purpose:** Improve the structure, readability, or efficiency of the code without changing its functionality. This step is crucial for maintaining code quality and manageability.
- **Example:** We might refactor our `calculateTotalPrice` method to make it more readable or efficient.

  ```java
  public double calculateTotalPrice() {
      return items.stream()
                  .mapToDouble(item -> item.getPrice() * item.getQuantity())
                  .sum();
  }
  ```
  Here, the method is refactored to use Java Streams for more concise and readable code. The test still passes, but the code quality is improved.

### TDD Cycle Continues
After refactoring, you would start the cycle again for the next piece of functionality or requirement. This approach ensures that you always have a suite of tests checking the correctness of your code, and it encourages writing code that is more modular, testable, and maintainable.
