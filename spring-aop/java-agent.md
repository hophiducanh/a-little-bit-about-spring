## [Java Agent - A powerful tool you might have missed](https://sathiyakugan.medium.com/java-agent-a-powerful-tool-you-might-have-missed-fe6a85884481)

Let’s say that you have an application running in production. Every once in a time it gets into a broken state, it’s hard to reproduce, you need some more information out of the application.

So are you wondering about the solution?
what you could do is dynamically attach some set of code to your application and carefully rewrite it so that the code dumps additional information you can log or else you can dump the application stage into a text file. Jave is giving us a facility to do this using Java Agent. Have we ever wondered how our Java code is hot-swapped in our IDE? It’s because of agents. Another interesting fact about Java agent is Application profilers are using the same technique at the backend to collect information of memory usage, memory leakage and execution time of methods.

> Java agents are a special type of class which, by using the Java Instrumentation API, can intercept applications running on the JVM, modifying their bytecode. Java agents are extremely powerful and also dangerous.

## Java static agent and dynamic agent

**Java static and dynamic agents** are two types of software modules that can be used to modify the behavior of a Java application at runtime.

**Static agents** are loaded into the JVM before the application starts. They can modify the bytecode of the application before it is executed. This can be used to add new functionality to the application or to change the behavior of existing functionality.

**Dynamic agents** can be loaded into the JVM after the application has started. They cannot modify the bytecode of the application, but they can intercept and modify the calls to the application's methods. This can be used to add logging, monitoring, or security functionality to the application.

**Advantages of static agents:**

* Static agents can modify the bytecode of the application, which gives them more power and flexibility than dynamic agents.
* Static agents are loaded before the application starts, so they do not have any impact on the startup time of the application.

**Disadvantages of static agents:**

* Static agents are more complex to develop and use than dynamic agents.
* Static agents can modify the behavior of the application in unexpected ways, so it is important to test them thoroughly before using them in production.

**Advantages of dynamic agents:**

* Dynamic agents are easier to develop and use than static agents.
* Dynamic agents have no impact on the startup time of the application.
* Dynamic agents can be loaded and unloaded at runtime, so they can be used to add or remove functionality from the application without restarting the application.

**Disadvantages of dynamic agents:**

* Dynamic agents cannot modify the bytecode of the application, so they are less powerful than static agents.
* Dynamic agents can add overhead to the application, so it is important to use them judiciously.

**Examples of static agents:**

* The Java Management Extensions (JMX) agent is a static agent that provides a way to monitor and manage Java applications.
* The Java Debug Interface (JDI) agent is a static agent that provides a way to debug Java applications.
* The Java HotSpot compiler is a static agent that optimizes Java bytecode for performance.

**Examples of dynamic agents:**

* The Java SecurityManager is a dynamic agent that provides security features for Java applications.
* The Java profiler is a dynamic agent that can be used to collect performance data about Java applications.
* The Java AspectJ agent is a dynamic agent that can be used to implement cross-cutting concerns in Java applications.

**Which type of agent to use:**

The best type of agent to use depends on the specific needs of the application. If the application needs to modify the bytecode or if performance is critical, then a static agent should be used. If the application needs to add or remove functionality at runtime or if flexibility is important, then a dynamic agent should be used.
