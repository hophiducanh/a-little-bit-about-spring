## Why first class citizen is call first class citizen?

The term "first class citizen" in programming comes from the **idea of treating something as equal to other entities within a system**. It's a metaphorical way to express that **certain elements or constructs in a programming language are given the same rights and capabilities as fundamental data types or objects**. The concept originated in the field of programming language design and is used to describe the treatment of various programming constructs.

Here's why they are called "first-class citizens":

1. **Equal Rights**: First-class citizens are granted equal status, rights, and privileges within the programming language. They can be manipulated, passed as arguments to functions, returned from functions, assigned to variables, and stored in data structures just like any other data type or object.

2. **No Discrimination**: When something is a first-class citizen, there is no discrimination against it in terms of what you can do with it in the language. It enjoys all the capabilities and freedoms that built-in types and objects have.

3. **Fundamental Role**: First-class citizens often play a fundamental role in the language's paradigm or design philosophy. For example, in functional programming, functions are typically considered first-class citizens because functions can be treated like data and operated upon just like any other data type.

Here are some examples of what can be first-class citizens in various programming paradigms:

- **Functions in Functional Programming**: In functional programming languages like JavaScript and Python, functions are often considered first-class citizens. You can pass functions as arguments to other functions, return functions from functions, and assign functions to variables.

- **Objects in Object-Oriented Programming**: In object-oriented programming languages like Java and C++, objects are typically treated as first-class citizens. You can create objects, pass them around, and manipulate them in various ways.

- **Lambda Expressions in Java 8 and Later**: In Java, lambda expressions are first-class citizens introduced to make functional programming constructs more accessible. You can pass lambda expressions as arguments to methods, store them in variables, and return them from methods.

The term "first-class citizen" is a way to emphasize the importance of certain programming constructs within a language or framework and the extent to which they are empowered to participate in the language's core operations. It signifies that these constructs are not treated as second-class or special cases but are integral to the language's design and capabilities.
