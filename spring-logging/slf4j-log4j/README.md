Sure, here are the steps on how to use SLF4J with Log4J:

1. Add the SLF4J and Log4J dependencies to your project.
2. Configure Log4J.
3. Use the SLF4J API to log messages.

Here are the details for each step:

1. **Add the SLF4J and Log4J dependencies to your project.**

To add the SLF4J and Log4J dependencies to your project, you can use a dependency management tool like Maven or Gradle.

For Maven, you can add the following dependencies to your pom.xml file:

```
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.slf4j</groupId>
    <artifactId>slf4j-api</artifactId>
    <version>1.7.30</version>
</dependency>

<dependency>
    <groupId>org.apache.logging.log4j</groupId>
    <artifactId>log4j-slf4j-impl</artifactId>
    <version>2.17.0</version>
</dependency>
```

For Gradle, you can add the following dependencies to your build.gradle file:

```
dependencies {
    implementation 'org.slf4j:slf4j-api:1.7.30'
    implementation 'org.apache.logging.log4j:log4j-slf4j-impl:2.17.0'
}
```

2. **Configure Log4J.**

Once you have added the SLF4J and Log4J dependencies to your project, you need to configure Log4J.

The Log4J configuration file is called log4j.properties. You can find this file in the src/main/resources directory of your project.

The log4j.properties file contains configuration settings for Log4J. You can use these settings to configure the logging levels, appenders, and layouts for your application.

For more information on configuring Log4J, you can refer to the Log4J documentation.

3. **Use the SLF4J API to log messages.**

Once you have configured Log4J, you can use the SLF4J API to log messages.

The SLF4J API provides a number of methods for logging messages. You can use these methods to log messages at different levels, such as INFO, DEBUG, and ERROR.

For example, the following code logs a message at the INFO level:

```
Logger logger = LoggerFactory.getLogger(YourClass.class);
logger.info("This is an info message");
```

The SLF4J implementation will then delegate this call to the underlying logging framework. For example, if we are using Log4J as the underlying logging framework, the SLF4J implementation will call the `info()` method on the Log4J logger.

The underlying logging framework will then log the message to its configured destination, such as a file, a console, or a database.

I hope this helps you understand how to use SLF4J with Log4J.
