In simple terms, the main difference between tasks and threads in Java lies in their nature and usage:

1. Task:
   A task in Java refers to a unit of work or a job that needs to be executed. It represents a specific piece of functionality that you want to perform. Tasks are typically defined as implementations of the `Runnable` or `Callable` interfaces in Java.

- Runnable: Represents a task that can be executed asynchronously and does not return any result.
- Callable: Represents a task that can be executed asynchronously and returns a result.

Related Terms:
- Asynchronous: Tasks can be executed independently of the main program flow, allowing multiple tasks to run concurrently.
- Executor: An executor is responsible for managing the execution of tasks. It provides a way to submit tasks for execution and manages thread pools.

2. Thread:
   A thread in Java is the smallest unit of execution in a program. It represents a single sequential flow of control within a process. Threads allow tasks to run concurrently and can be thought of as lightweight processes.

Related Terms:
- Concurrency: Threads enable concurrent execution, where multiple tasks can run simultaneously, sharing the same resources.
- Context Switching: The process of saving the state of one thread and restoring the state of another thread to allow multiple threads to run concurrently.

In summary, tasks represent units of work that need to be executed, while threads are the mechanisms that allow tasks to run concurrently. Threads are used to execute tasks, and tasks are the actual units of functionality you want to perform asynchronously.
