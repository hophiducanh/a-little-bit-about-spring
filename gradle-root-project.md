## What happen when I run gradle wrapper at root folder in multi-project gradle if each module already has its own gradle wrapper files?

If each submodule in a multi-project Gradle build already has its own Gradle Wrapper (i.e., each submodule has its own `gradle-wrapper.properties`, `gradlew`, and `gradlew.bat`), and you run `gradle wrapper` in the root folder of the multi-project Gradle build, the following typically occurs:

1. **Gradle Wrapper in the Root Project:**

    - Running `gradle wrapper` in the root project directory generates a new set of Gradle Wrapper files (`gradle-wrapper.properties`, `gradlew`, and `gradlew.bat`) in the root directory of the entire multi-project build.

2. **No Impact on Submodule Wrappers:**

    - Importantly, running `gradle wrapper` in the root folder does not remove or modify the existing Gradle Wrappers in the individual submodules. The submodules will retain their own Gradle Wrapper configuration and files.

3. **Gradle Distribution Configuration:**

    - The newly generated `gradle-wrapper.properties` file in the root project will specify a Gradle distribution URL, distribution type, and version. This configuration will be specific to the root project and may differ from the configurations in the individual submodule wrappers.

4. **Running Gradle Commands:**

    - You can use the Gradle Wrapper in the root project directory to run Gradle commands that affect the root project itself. This allows you to build or execute tasks at the root project level.

    - If you want to perform tasks in a specific submodule, you can navigate to that submodule's directory and use the submodule's existing Gradle Wrapper (`./gradlew` or `gradlew.bat`) to execute tasks for that submodule. The submodule's Gradle Wrapper will use its own distribution and settings.

In summary, running `gradle wrapper` in the root folder of a multi-project Gradle build generates a new Gradle Wrapper configuration specific to the root project, without impacting the existing Gradle Wrappers in the individual submodules. Each submodule can still be built and configured independently using its own Gradle Wrapper. This setup allows for flexibility in managing Gradle versions and configurations for the root project and its submodules.

## What is purpose of  generates a new set of Gradle Wrapper files if each module have its own gradle wrapper files?

If each module in a multi-project Gradle build already has its own Gradle Wrapper files and configurations, running `gradle wrapper` in the root folder of the multi-project build may not be necessary or may not serve a significant purpose. This is because the existing Gradle Wrappers in the individual modules are designed to handle the configuration and execution of Gradle for each submodule independently.

However, there are a few scenarios where generating a new set of Gradle Wrapper files in the root folder might be considered:

1. **Standardization:** If you want to enforce a consistent Gradle version or distribution type across all submodules, you can run `gradle wrapper` in the root folder with the desired configuration. This ensures that contributors to the project will use the specified Gradle version when they build any part of the project.

2. **Convenience:** Having a root-level Gradle Wrapper can be convenient for developers who are working primarily on the root project itself. It allows them to use the same wrapper script (`./gradlew` or `gradlew.bat`) to execute tasks at both the root and submodule levels without needing to navigate to individual submodule directories.

3. **Build Automation:** If you have automated build processes that involve building multiple submodules together as part of a single build, a root-level Gradle Wrapper can simplify the build scripting by providing a common entry point for building the entire project.

4. **Distribution:** If you plan to distribute your multi-project Gradle build to others who may not be familiar with the submodule structure, having a root-level Gradle Wrapper can make it easier for them to get started, as they only need to execute commands from the root directory.

In summary, the purpose of generating a new set of Gradle Wrapper files at the root level in a multi-project Gradle build is typically to provide a standardized configuration and a common entry point for certain scenarios. However, it's important to consider whether this is necessary for your specific project and whether it aligns with your project's requirements and conventions. In many cases, relying on the existing submodule-level Gradle Wrappers may be sufficient.
